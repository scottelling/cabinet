/**
 * The tracer bullet: the core product loop, end to end, through every layer.
 *
 *   harness → seeded CABINET_DATA_DIR → daemon → Next.js app → browser
 *           → conversation API → adapter → fake `claude` CLI → SSE → DOM
 *
 * The agent is a fake CLI replaying canned stream JSON, so this needs no API key
 * and no network — which is what makes it safe to block merges and to run on
 * fork PRs.
 *
 * The second test is the other half of the same contract. What the browser shows
 * only proves Cabinet parsed the CLI's *output*; it says nothing about what
 * Cabinet *asked for*. A regression that dropped `--output-format stream-json`,
 * or passed the prompt as an argv instead of on stdin, would still render a
 * reply here — and would fail against a real Claude. So we assert on the
 * recorded invocation too.
